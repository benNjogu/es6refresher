      POSITION:
      static:- element sits in its normal place in the document.

      relative:- element still takes up space in the document, but now the top and the left style properties can 
      be used to move it relative to that normal place.

      absolute:- element is removed from the normal document flow, i.e it no longer takes up space and may 
      overlap with other elements.
